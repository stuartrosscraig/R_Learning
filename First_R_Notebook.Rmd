This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
"here is the first R chunk I've tried to write"
var_1 <- 345
var_1

var_2 <- "Hi there"
var_2

var_3 <- FALSE
var_3

is.character(var_2)
var_4 <- as.character(var_1)
var_4
class(var_4)

```

```{python}
list_var = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
print(list_var)
# This is not really python, I don't know what this is
```

```{r}
v_1 <- 3453; v_2 <- "iifvb"; v_3 <- TRUE

v_1; v_2; v_3

```
